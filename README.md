# Visual-Search-Paradigm
Visual Search stimulus, data collection, and analysis
Show two conditions (pop-out search versus conjunction search) with four levels each (set size 5 4, 8, 12, 16). These conditions can be blocked (first all pop-out searches, then all conjunction searches or something like that).
• It is imperative to randomly interleave trials with and without target. There should be an equal number of trials with and without targets.
• Make sure that the number of green and red stimuli (if you are red/green blind, use blue and red) is balanced in the conjunction search (it should be 50%/50%). Also, make sure that there is an equal number of x and o elements, if possible.
• Use only correct trials (user indicated no target present when no target was presented or indicated target present when it was present) for the analysis.
• Try to be as quick as possible while making sure to be right. It would be suboptimal if you had a speed/accuracy trade-off in your data.
• The analysis should contain at least 20 correct trials per level and condition for a total of 160 trials. They should go quickly (about 1 second each).
• Pick two keys on the keyboard to indicate responses (one for target present, one for target absent).
• Report and graph the mean reaction times for correct trials as a function of pop-out search versus conjunction search and for trials where the target is present versus where
the target is absent. Hence, you need between two and four figures. You can combine graphs for comparison (see below).
Report the Pearson correlation coefficients between reaction time and set size and indicate whether it is significant or not (for each condition).
Make a qualitative assessment of the slopes in the different conditions (we will talk about curve fitting in a later chapter).
